    <h1>The Users discription</h1>
    <p>The stackoverflow have over 100 million+ users a month. So we all can understand that this is one of the most popular webisdde in the world.
        here ar some of the vocies fome the users:</p>
    <p> Stackoverflow is amazing. For just about any problem I have I find the answer there. The level of knowledge is very high and answers are generally well spelled out.
        Hmm. 
        They didn’t like your questions? Plural, questions? Look, I don’t remember ever posting a question on Stack Overflow because every question I had was answered there. 
        So if you posted more than one question, you probably didn’t search very hard.
        Are you a beginning programmer? 
        There are millions really nice tutorials around. 
        When you had a question did you work your way through at least 2 or 3 tutorials before you gave up and posted your question?</p>
        <p> NOT A FORUM
        Whatever you ask there must have a specific answer; hence you cannot ask questions that merely seeking an opinion (“Why do people hate PHP?”) or is subjective in nature (“Am I a good programmer”). 
        It’s also not a place to debate, or to push an agenda.
        This is why troubleshooting questions (or “why doesn’t my code work>”) questions are usually not suitable. Code don’t work for many reasons, and sometimes it’s not the code itself that is problematic but perhaps an environment variable or a configuration setting somewhere. Stack Overflow is not suitable for this kind of back and forth. </p>
